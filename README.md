# Nauticulos_WIP
A memory building puzzle game

Try the DEMO version of the game on itch https://jackalldigital.itch.io/nauticulos-demo

The goal of the game is to give as few input commands as possible to the diver (Nauticulos) get to the treasure chest,
while also picking up the key and avoiding the various obstacles.

I spent way too much time on the mechanic where you crash into the wall and it turns you in a random direction,
however as this game was primarily made with children in mind I think it adds a fun element to the game. The idea
for the game came about when I taught children how to give inputs to toy robots in a similar way. And since children
had problem making one big chain to get to the goal, that is why I think it's fine for the wall crash mechanic to be
in the game as it will give them somethig more to think about, and as I have badges at the end of each level it will
also give them incentive to think better and memorise more.


This is how the game currently looks like, I have added a total of 20 levels that teaches all different mechanics
